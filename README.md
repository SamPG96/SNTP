# Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) Client and Server

As part of one of my second year undergraduate assignments, I had to produce an RFC compliant
SNTP client and server(RFC4330).
Note that the client and server use a combination of configuration files and command line arguments.

I was graded a 2:1 on this assignment.
