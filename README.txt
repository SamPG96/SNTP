Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) Client and Server
=====================================================

This repository contains my output from an assignment during my second year of studies.
I was assigned to producing an RFC compliant SNTP client and server(RFC4330).
Note that the client and server use a combination of configuration files and command line arguments.

I was graded a 1st on this assignment.
